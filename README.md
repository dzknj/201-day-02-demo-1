# 201-day-02-demo
A demo repo for practicing using GitHub! (And hopefully for avoiding gitshows)

This is an .md file (stands for markdown)

DATA TYPES
  * strings - text
  * numbers - numbers, including integers and floats
  * booleans - true/false

JS allows you to put any type of data into any variable. Like the honeybadger, JS don't care.

OPERATORS

= assignment
== equivalent (loose equals - tries to force types to be the same - "type coercion")
=== strict equals - cares about type
