        <h2>Guess Caleb's birth year!</h2>
        <p>This is a little JavaScript exercise I created for fun!</p>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            var yearGuess = prompt('In what year was I born?');
            if(yearGuess < 1984) {
              alert('I\'m not THAT old!');
            } else if(yearGuess >= 1985) {
              alert('I WISH I was that young!');
            } else if (yearGuess == 1984) {
              alert('Yep, you got it!');
            } else {
              alert('Whoops, looks like you did not guess a valid year!');
            }
            console.log('The user guessed the year' + ' ' + yearGuess + '.');
